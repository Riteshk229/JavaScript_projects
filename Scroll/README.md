# Scroll
In this project,we are  implementing **smooth scroll** for larger as well as for smaller 
screen when clicked on the links on the **Navbar**.

On **Larger screens**, the **Navbar** becomes fixed when scrolling a little bit, and on clicking the links on the navbar we can go that section of the page. The height of the section was calculated using JavaScript to make the scrolling smooth.

On **Smaller screens**, links can be accessed by clicking on the **Navbar Toogle** on the top right which will take you to the desired section on clicking.

After scrolling a certain height a **back to top** button will be shown.
